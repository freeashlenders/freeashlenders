When it comes to money lending, payday loans are becoming one of the most popular alternative solutions to high-street bank loans. However, like all loans, they do have to be paid back at some point and in the case of payday loans, paying them back on time is imperative. In order to help with the repayment process, it is always prudent to understand just how payday loans are made and more importantly what you, as a consumer needs to know about the whole process.

The first thing that a consumer will need to understand is that a payday loan is designed to be paid back in one lump sum and over a period of no longer than one month. This means that there are no installments for the borrower to worry about, thus allowing them to better focus on paying off their loan right away and staying on top of their finances. Additionally, one swift payment means that the loan won't incur any more interest.
